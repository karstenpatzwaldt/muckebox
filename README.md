muckebox
========

This is a lightweight tool written in Python that will scan a folder containing your music library, catalog your collection into a database, and provide a RESTish interface that supports browsing and streaming with optional transcoding.

It has no interface of its own besides the log output yet, so unless you like reading JSON, you may want to try https://github.com/karstenpatzwaldt/muckebox-android along with this server.
